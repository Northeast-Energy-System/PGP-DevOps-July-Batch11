 Git workflow 

git configuration commnds
=============================

Configuration are nothing but variables to which we set some values and the tool uses them during workflows

In case of git also, it provides a set of configuration variables that we will set up in order to update git log

git log is nothing but--> which user did what chnage and when the chnage, what chnages were done, time

when you working in a local machine--> when we commit the chnages in local repo, we cna see the name of the user that has commited the change

But when we push the data form local to remote, it become important for everyone to know which has come form which user

which user performed the commit


So in local repo we have to set up 2 configurations variables:

These are given to your by git, you cannot chnage there names

The names of varibale are :

user.name

user.email

The value to the variables is given by the user

These configurations have 3 types of scope:

> local configuration --> configuration variable will be applicable only to the current repository

> global configuration --> configuration variable will be applicable to every repository created by user that is logged in the machine

git config --global user.name sonal0409

By executing this command, git will use sonal0409 in its log (author) for every commit done in any repository
created by user root


root user --> creates repo1 --> you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be sonal0409

root user --> create a new WD -->creates repo2 --> you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be sonal0409

root user --> reate a WD -->creates repo3 --> you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be sonal0409


Where are these GLOBAL configuration stored?

they are stored in :  ~/.gitconfig

Set configurations:

git config --global user.name sonal0409

Edit configuration:

git config --global --edit

Delete configurations

git config --global --unset user.name 

git config --global --unset user.email

====================================
Local configuration:
=================================

Every repository you create on the machine, it will have its unique configuration


sonal user --> creates repo1 -->I set local config(user.name sonal)
 you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be sonal

jaaya user --> create a new WD -->creates repo2 -->->I set local config(user.name jaya)
 you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be jaya

marc user --> create a new WD -->creates repo2 -->->I set local config(user.name marc)
 you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be marc

local configuration of a repository can be found in:

.git/config


what is the difference between cat .git/config va cat ~/gitconfig


local configuration of a repository can be found in:

.git/config


Where are these GLOBAL configuration stored?

they are stored in :  ~/.gitconfig

=============================================

System configuration:

configuration applicable at OS level


in the VM I set system config(user.name sonal0409)

sonal user --> creates repo1 -->
 you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be sonal0409

jaaya user --> create a new WD -->creates repo2 -->-
 you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be sonal0409

marc user --> create a new WD -->creates repo2 
 you do a commit--> check the log -->author will be sonal0409


First when we create a repository-->whenever we commit --> it will check for local config(.git/config)

if no local config--> then check for global conf (~/.gitconfig) --> if no global config

then check for system config( /etc/gitconfig)
